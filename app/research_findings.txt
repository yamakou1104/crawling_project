## Images
For images, I found:

1. The main article image is in a figure element
2. The image URL can be found at index 3 in the list of images: 
   - https://newsatcl-pctr.c.yimg.jp/t/iwiz-yn/rpr/kubotahiroyuki/02117088/title-1740706712438.jpeg?exp=10800
3. This image has the class 'sc-1fea4ol-16 iUhuPO'
4. The image is also contained within a figure element with a caption

## Selectors to Use
